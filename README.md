# PayloadSpinner3DS

## What is this?
Dirty little homebrew I made for swapping boot.firm files.  Useful for switching from Luma3DS to ReiNAND to CakesFW.  In case you want to do that in the first place.  

## Why would I want to use this?
If you have to ask, this isn't for you.  Simply said, if you see no reason at all to use this application, don't.  Just click off this page and forget you saw anything.

## How do I use this?
First, make sure you have all relevant CFW files ready on your SD Card.  Put your payloads in `3ds/data/PayloadSpinner3DS/`.  From there, install PayloadSpinner3DS, start it up, and select which payload to set as your `boot.firm`.  The application will give you the option to reboot after your `boot.firm` is replaced.

# Features I want to implement eventually
 - JSON customization (support for custom themes, descriptions for payloads, etc.)
 - idk that's kinda it I guess
