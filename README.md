# PayloadSpinner3DS

## What is this?
Dirty little homebrew I made for swapping `boot.firm` files.  Useful for switching from Luma3DS to ReiNAND to CakesFW.  In case you want to do that in the first place.  

## Why would I want to use this?
It makes for quick and easy hotswapping of `boot.firm` files, which can be mildly useful for developers or power users.  For example, if you want to switch from Luma to A9NC or GodMode9, this little homebrew makes it easier to swap than by manually renaming the files through GodMode9 or CTRXplorer.

It's also pretty useful for those who use multiple CFW and want to swap quickly.  PayloadSpinner3DS makes it trivial for one to switch from Luma to Cakes.  Yes.  Cakes has B9S support.  Look it up.

## How do I use this?
First, make sure you have all relevant CFW files ready on your SD Card.  Put your payloads in `3ds/data/PayloadSpinner3DS/`.  From there, install PayloadSpinner3DS, start it up, and select which payload to set as your `boot.firm`.  The application will give you the option to reboot after your `boot.firm` is replaced.

## Features I want to implement eventually
 - JSON customization (support for custom themes, descriptions for payloads, etc.)
 - idk that's kinda it I guess
